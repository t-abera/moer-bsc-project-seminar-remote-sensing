## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to

* know the basics about different sensor types used in remote sensing,
* have an understanding of the light spectrum,
* know why we are able to measure different things from space, 
* grasp the advantages and disadvantages of different satellite products, and
* work with Sentinel data in R.



## Remote Sensing

Working with remote sensing data requires many decisions prior to data acquisition.
Do I use spectral data? If so, what resolutions do I need? For which year will I need my Earth observations?
Do I need time series? Most of these questions are dependent on the research goal (obviously!).
However, an overview of what data is out there is very helpful for these decisions.

A good starting point can found in [Pettorelli et al. 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324537528_Conservation_Technology_Series_Issue_4_SATELLITE_REMOTE_SENSING_FOR_CONSERVATION){:target="_blank"}.
Although it is a bit wordy and tailored towards nature conservation by the WWF, the guide is not too technical and understandable without much prior knowledge.
Some good figures from this guide are used in the subsequent units.
