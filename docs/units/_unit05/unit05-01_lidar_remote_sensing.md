Learn the basic of Lidar remote sensing.

<!--more-->


## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to

* know the basics of the LiDAR technique,
* have an understanding of how LiDAR is used in forestry, and
* work with LiDAR Data in R.



## LiDAR kick off

Please read the article by [Baessler et al. 2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-010-9959-x){:target="_blank"}. 
Focus on the LiDAR applications and what the authors tried to find out with LiDAR data. 
Do not become desperate if you do not fully understand the statistical methods (do not be afraight of terms like "flexible discriminant analysis").
Answer the follwing questions (each with a few bullet points): 

* What is the research goal of the article?
* What are the main advantages of LiDAR compared to field work in a forest environment?
* Which information from LiDAR was the most useful to describe forest structure?
* What are the drawbacks of LiDAR in this study?
