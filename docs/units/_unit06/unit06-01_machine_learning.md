## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to

* understand the basic concepts in machine learning,
* prepare your data for machine learning,
* train a random forest model,
* make predictions with the model,
* tune your model, and
* validate your model.


## Machine learning kick off

To get an overview about the large field called "machine learning", you can watch the videos below or do some internet research on your own. There are some great tutorials out there.
