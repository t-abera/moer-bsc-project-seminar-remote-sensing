Apply your gained skills in your own work project.

<!--more-->

You now have all the knowledge and tools available for your own machine learning work project.
There are several posibilities to move on, e.g.:


## Improve the predictions

The random forest models and predictions of the mean vegetation height in Unit 6 were not that great.
You could now focus on improving the model by using additional predictors, more training data or multi-temporal satellite imagery.


## Compare model types

You could compare random forest models with other model types like support vector machines or a neural networks.


## Use different response variables

During the course we used the mean vegetation height as an example. Of course you can try to model a different LiDAR-derived index.
